# Privacy Policy for Readwise Reader Importer

tldr; I'm not collecting any data, but need to have this file for Google.

## Overview
Readwise Reader Importer is a Chrome extension designed to help users save multiple links to their Readwise Reader account. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

## Data Collection
**We do not collect any personal data or information whatsoever.** The extension operates entirely on your local browser and only:
- Temporarily processes the URLs you choose to save
- Stores your Readwise API token locally in your browser's storage
- Communicates directly with Readwise's API to save your links

## Data Storage
- Your Readwise API token is stored locally in your browser using Chrome's secure storage API
- No data is transmitted to our servers
- No analytics or tracking tools are implemented
- No cookies are used
- No user behavior is monitored or recorded

## Third-Party Services
The only external service this extension interacts with is Readwise's API, and this is solely for the purpose of saving your links to your Readwise Reader account. This interaction happens only when you explicitly choose to save links. Any links and data saved to Readwise through this extension are subject to [Readwise's Privacy Policy](https://readwise.io/privacy).

## Changes to This Policy
Any changes to this privacy policy will be communicated through an extension update, and the latest version will always be available in this repository.

## Contact
If you have any questions about this privacy policy or the extension's data practices, please open an issue in the GitHub repository.
